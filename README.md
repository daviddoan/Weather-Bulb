// A LED lightbulb that pulses different patterns depending on local weather.

For a short workshop, I designed and built a LED PCB that can accept input from the computer through Serial connection.

I took apart a lightbulb and replaced the old filament with my PCB, which is programmed to have different lighting patterns depending on the input.

The python program runs on your computer to send information to the PCB, which will then light depending on the specified local weather.
